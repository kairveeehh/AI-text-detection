# AI-Generated Text Detection using BERT
### Project in regard to the kaggle contest https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text

## Introduction

AI-Generated Text Detection using BERT is a project aimed at detecting AI-generated text segments within a given dataset. Leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), the project addresses the challenge of distinguishing between genuine human-authored content and computer-generated text. By implementing advanced natural language processing techniques, the model contributes to enhancing cybersecurity and integrity in digital communications.

## Work Flow

The project follows a structured workflow:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preprocessing textual data to remove noise, stop words, punctuation, and non-alphabetic characters using BERT-preprocess.

- **Additional Datasets:** Collecting various datasets from competitions and concatenating them to increase the training instances. This step enhances the model's ability to identify features and patterns effectively.

- **Model Training:** Utilizing a BERT-based sequence classification model to train the system to distinguish between human and AI-generated text segments accurately.

- **Predictions:** Generating predictions on test data to highlight potential AI-generated content segments.

- **Result Analysis:** Saving the results in a CSV file for submission and further analysis.
