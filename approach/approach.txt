### Project Approach: AI-text detection 
this project was in regard to the kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text

The project ---AI-Generated Text detection using BERT( Bi-directional Encoder Representation Transformer) is from the
family of LLMs, which has been used for the classification of human-authored texts and AI-generated texts.
It uses various feature selection techniques in the core for categorizing the texts generated by the two groups.
It detects the two based on semantic differences, usage of vocabulary, statistical distributions, and sentiment
analysis measures. This detection method comes in the family of Black-Box Detection Algorithms for AI-Text
Detection

#### 1. **Introduction**
   - AI-generated content is becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it challenging to distinguish between
genuine and computer-generated text. Fraud emails and Fake news are becoming every dayâ€™s stories.
 My project aims to tackle this issue by leveraging the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers) to identify and flag AI-generated text segments. This would allow the AI to advance at
a much faster pace but not at the expense of human security and fundamental integrity

#### 2. **Importing Libraries**
   - Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.

#### 3. **Dataset Loading**
   - Loaded the training and test datasets from specified paths using `pd.read_csv`.
   - Inspected the loaded datasets for initial understanding.
   
#### 4. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
   - Performed basic analysis using `info()` and `value_counts()` to understand data characteristics.
   - Visualized data distribution using `countplot` and `pie chart` for 'prompt_id' and 'generated' columns.
   - Identified data imbalance and selected appropriate target label for analysis.

#### 5. **Data Pre-processing**
   - Utilized `stopwords_text` library to filter out stopwords from essays.
   - Combined additional datasets to enrich training data variety and quantity.
   - Concatenated and preprocessed datasets to prepare for model training.

#### 6. **Model Building**
   - Split the preprocessed data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.
   - Implemented BERT-based model architecture using TensorFlow Hub.
   - Defined model layers, compiled with optimizer and loss function, and summarized the model architecture.
   - Trained the model with training data, validated with test data, and saved the best model using callbacks.

#### 7. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model performance on training and test data using `evaluate` method.
   - Checked accuracy and loss metrics to assess model performance.

#### 8. **Predictions**
   - Generated predictions on test essay data using the trained model.
   - Created a DataFrame for submission with 'id' and 'generated' columns.

#### 9. **Output Generation**
   - Saved the submission DataFrame to a CSV file without index for submission.
   - Outputted the submission DataFrame for further analysis.

#### 10. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Summarized the key findings, challenges, and solutions encountered during the project.
   - Provided recommendations for improving model performance and future work.
   - Documented the entire process for reproducibility and reference purposes.
